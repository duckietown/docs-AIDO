# Tensorflow Template for `aido3-LF*` {#tensorflow-template status=ready}

This section describes the basic procedure for making a submission with a model trained in using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It can be used as a starting point for any of the [`LF`](#lf), [`LFV`](#lf_v), and [`LFVI`](#lf_v_i) challenges.

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: That you have setup your [accounts](#cm-accounts).

Requires: That you meet the [software requirement](#cm-sw). Make sure you have [tensorflow](#cm-sw-tensorflow)

Result: You make a submission to all of the `LF*` challenges and can view their status and output.

## Quickstart

### Clone the [template repo](https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido_LF-template-tensorflow):

    $ git clone -b daffy git@github.com:duckietown/challenge-aido_LF-template-tensorflow.git


### Change into the directory:

    $ cd challenge-aido_LF-template-tensorflow
    
### Run the submission:

Either make a submission with:

    $ dts challenges submit


Or, run local evaluation with:

    $ dts challenges evaluate

### Verify your submission(s)

This will make a number of submissions (as described below). You can track the status of these submissions in the command line with:

    $ dts challenges follow --submission ![SUBMISSION_NUMBER]

or through your browser by navigating the webpage: `https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/humans/submissions/![SUBMISSION_NUMBER]`

where `![SUBMISSION_NUMBER]` should be replaced with the number of the submission which is reported in the terminal output. 

## Anatomy of the submission

The submission consists of all of the basic files that required for a [basic submission](#minimal-template). Below we will highlight the specifics with respect to this template. 


### `solution.py`

The only difference in `solution.py` is that we are calling our model to compute an action with the following code:

```python
    def compute_action(self, observation):
        action = self.model.predict(observation)
        return action.astype(float)
```

### Model files

The other additional files are the following:

    tf_models/
    model.py
    
The directory `tf_models/` contains the Tensorflow learned models (the ones that you have trained).

The `model.py` code is the code that runs the Tensorflow model

For some options for how to train these models you can check out [](#embodied_il_sim) or [](#embodied_il_logs).
