# Challenge `LF` {#challenge-LF status=ready}

The first challenge of the *AI Driving Olympics* is "lane following" (`LF`).

In this challenge, we ask participants to submit code allowing the Duckiebot to drive on the right-hand side of the street within Duckietown without a specific goal point. Duckiebots will drive through the Duckietown and will be judged on how fast they drive, how well they follow the rules and how smooth or "comfortable" their driving is.

Please refer to the following [video of a lane following demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/198iythQkovbQkzY3pPeTXWC8tTCRgDwB/view?usp=sharing) for a short demonstration.

A description of the [specific rules](#part:aido-rules) is provided.

The challenge is designed in a way that allows for a completely \emph{reactive} algorithm design, i.e., to accomplish the challenge it is not strictly necessary to keep past observations in memory. 

In particular intersections will not be part of maps for this challenge. 

## Templates and Baselines {status=ready}

To get started, try one of the existing [templates](#part:embodied), which are minimal setups that do random things but are functions, or the [baselines](#part:embodied-strategies) which are instantiations of the templates that implement some algorithms, but not in an optimal way. Additionally, many of the past AI-DO winners are in the baseline solutions. 

## `LF` in Simulation {#challenge-aido_lf status=ready}

The current versions of the lane following simulation challenges are  `aido-LF-sim-testing` and `aido-LF-sim-validation`. These two challenges are identical except for the output that you are allowed to see. In the case of `testing` you will be able to see performance of your agent ([](#fig:submission-output-lf))  and you will be able to download the logs and artifacts.

## `LF` in the Duckietown Autolab {#challenge-aido_lf-real status=ready}

The current version of the lane following real robot challenge is  `aido-LF-real-validation`. 

Note that to test the performance of your agent on the real robot yourself, you can follow
[the instructions to run your agent on your Duckiebot](#challenge-LF_duckiebot)
