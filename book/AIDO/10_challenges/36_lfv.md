# Challenge `LFV` {#challenge-LFV status=ready}

The second challenge of the *AI Driving Olympics* is "lane following with dynamic vehicles" (`LFV`).
This challenge is an extension of Challenge `LF` to include additional rules of the road and other moving vehicles and static obstacles.

</figure>


Again we ask participants to submit code allowing the Duckiebot to drive on the right-hand side of the street within Duckietown. Due to interactions with other Duckiebots, a successful solution will likely not be completely \emph{reactive}. 

<!-- * This challenge uses the Duckietown challenge infrastructure. The precise definition of the challenge is in the [challenge definition repository](https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido_LF) -->


## `LFV` in Simulation {#challenge-aido2_lfv status=ready}

The current versions of the lane following with vehicles in simulation are `aido2-LFV-sim-testing` and `aido2-LF-sim-validation`. These two challenges are identical except for the output that you are allowed to see. In the case of `testing` you will be able to see performance of your agent ([](#fig:submission-output-lfv))  and you will be able to download the logs and artifacts.

## Templates {status=draft}

To get started, try one of the existing templates:

* The [random template](#minimal-template) is the most flexible
* The [TensorFlow template](#tensorflow-template) is the place to submit a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) submission
* The [PyTorch template](#pytorch-template) is the place to submit a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) submission
* The [ROS template](#ros-template) is the place to submit a submission using the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/). 

or baseline algorithms:

 - [Classical Duckietown stack](#ros-baseline),
 - [Reinforcement learning](#embodied_rl) (with PyTorch),
 - [Imitation learning from simulation](#embodied_il_sim) (with tensorflow),
 - [Imitation learning from real logs](#embodied_il_logs) (with tensorflow).
