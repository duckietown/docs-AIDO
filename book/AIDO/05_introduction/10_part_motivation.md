### Quick links

There are different challenges, different computational resource regimes and different performance categories in this competition.

* [Get started with your code submission](#part:quickstart)

### AI-DO 6 Urban League Challenges

* [Lane following (LF)](#challenge-LF)
* [Lane following with vehicles (LFV)](#challenge-LFV)
* [Lane following with intersections (LFVI)](#challenge-LFI)
* [Lane following with multiple vehicles and intersections where state information is given (LFVI--multi-stateful)](#challenge-LFVI-multi-stateful)

### Computational resources

* Purist option - RaspberryPi 3B+ (discontinued from AI-DO 6)
* Purist option - Jetson Nano (2 GB and 4 GB version)
* Remote option

Note that during the AI-DO 6 finals, the submissions will be run remotely.
