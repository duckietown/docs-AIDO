# Fleet-level social tasks {#social_tasks status=beta}

This section provides a brief introduction to the fleet-level social task "Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand".

  <!-- * [Fleet management (FM)](#nav_v): Task to control a small fleet of Duckiebots within Duckietown to pick up a set of virtual customers and drive them to a destination point. -->


  * [Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD)](#amod): Task to control the movement of a fleet of autonomous vehicles in a simulated city to pick up customers and drive them to their destinations.

----------------------------

The fleet-level tasks aim to work at a higher level of abstraction than the previous embodied robotic tasks [LF](#challenge-LF) and [LFV](#challenge-LF_v)<!-- [NAVV](#nav_v)-->. Crucially instead of focusing on single robots, now a fleet of robots should be controlled.

Picture a city with several already autonomous vehicles. The question now posed at the fleet-level is how to best control vehicles to serve customers.  


The actual social tasks will be described in more detail in ["Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand"](#amod). Note that the sequence of tasks was chosen to gradually increase the difficulty of tasks by extending previous task solutions to more general situations.

<!-- ## Further details

Since the fleet-level tasks differ in some points in terms of the used platform and evaluation, detailed information is presented separately in ["Fleet management"](#fleet_manag) and ["Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand"](#amod). -->


## Related Work

Fleet management is a field of research which is recently has received increase attention. This section briefly and non-exhaustively presents related work to the fleet management and AMoDeus challenge.

In \cite{horl2017fleet} several autonomous mobility-on-demand control algorithms were compared to a simulation scenario for the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It was shown
that a simple load-balancing heuristic reaches peak mean waiting times of 5 min with 10’000
vehicles, while more advanced control policies achieve the same performance with less than 9’000 vehicles.


A case study for Berlin presented in \cite{bischoff2016simulation} simulates city-wide replacement of transportation systems with robotic taxis in Berlin. The results are obtained with a heuristic algorithm and for a large number of agents.

In \cite{spieser2014toward} the authors use analytic results to estimate who  many robotic taxis could satisfy  the entire transportation demand of the country of Singapore. They estimate that $\approx 300,000$ taxis would be sufficient to serve demand with acceptable waiting times.

In \cite{zhang2016control} the relation of AMoD systems and queueing systems is detailed and a method to compute the fleet sizes required for certain levels of performance is presented.
