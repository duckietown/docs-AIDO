# Next steps towards winning the AI-DO {#quickstart-lanefollowing status=ready}

Now that you have made your first submission using the minimal template,
you can now move on to the next steps.

<minitoc/>

## Understand how the minimal template works

The anatomy of the minimal template is explained in [](#minimal-template).

You will understand how the Docker infrastructure works and how to create valid submissions.

## Select the template that you need

The minimal template you tried is a pure-Python template.
We offer [a few more templates to try](#embodied) if you want to use 
a framework.

In particular, you could try:

* the [TensorFlow template](#tensorflow-template);
* the [PyTorch template](#pytorch-template);
* the [ROS template](#ros-template).


## Try the baselines

In [](#embodied-strategies) we discuss our ``baselines'': submissions
that do something smart.


<!-- 
For the lane following challenge,  we are currently offering 4 suggested methods to do this (our baseline templates for these options are at various stages of readiness but will be getting updated very soon):


* Use ["classical" robotics and ROS](#ros-baseline)
* Use [reinforement learning](#embodied_rl)
* Use [imitation learning from data generated in the simulator](#embodied_il_sim)
* Use [imitation learning from data from real robots](#embodied_il_logs)
  
Of course you may also choose to use these methods in combination.  -->

## Understand the rules

You might want to read [](#part:aido-rules), which describes in detail how your score is generated for the specific challenges. 


## Try one of the harder challenges

In addition to the simple [LF challenge](#challenge-LF)
you can try the the [LFV challenge](#challenge-LFV)
the [LFI challenge](#challenge-LFI)
or the [LFVI-multi challenge](#challenge-LFVI-multi-stateful) where you have access to the state information.
