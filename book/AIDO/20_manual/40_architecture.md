# Architecture {#arch status=draft}

This section explains exactly what is going on when you create a submission.


## Definition of a challenge


## Duckietown Challenges Server (DCS)


## Evaluators


## Evaluation features {#evaluation-features}

Some submissions or evaluation containers require special features.

You can see the value of these features in [the description page of an evaluator](https://challenges.duckietown.org/v3/humans/evaluators/1).

TODO: make page with the codes for all features.


Most features are auto-detected by the evaluator.
A user can force values for the features [using the `--features` command](#evaluator-advanced-features).
